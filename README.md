I'm following [Evan's tutorial on setting up Django on a Joyent shared accelerator](http://ecarmi.org/writing/django-on-joyent/ "A (Complete) Guide to Running Django on Joyent Shared Accelerators using Virtualenv, pip, git, and NginX | ecarmi.org") and have created this simple static page publishing application as an example [Django Project](http://www.djangoproject.com/ "Django | The Web framework for perfectionists with deadlines") using Django's built-in [Flatpages app](http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/flatpages/ "Django | The flatpages app | Django documentation").
